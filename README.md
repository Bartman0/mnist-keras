## MNIST handwritten number recognization through the use of a neural network

This small project does handwritten number recognization using a neural network as a model trained with Keras.

The structure of the project is simple because the implementation in Python with the use of Keras makes this rather straightforward. Everything is in the root directory.
The main program is mnist_keras.py, to be run as: python ./mnist_keras.py

## Installation

1. git clone https://github.com/Bartman0/mnist-keras
2. cd mnist-keras
3. pip install -r requirements-frozen.txt

and then run it as:

python ./mnist_keras.py

## Run-time

A log will be shown of the first 5 characters in the test set.
At the end of the training, the batch of epochs, the outcome is shown to verify the results on those characters.
